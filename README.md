# homeschool_log
A web app to help log school subject hours and activities into a database for tracking and reporting.

The idea is to host this website privately within a home for personal use on something simple like a Raspberry Pi even. The goal is to have a simple interface for the user to quickly log a school activity and time, and whatever else is of importance to a homeschool teacher.

## How this works
* The server computer will store the homeschool db along with hosting the web interface for making entries.
* The site is accessed via phone through the local network.
* * This first go will require connection to my home network until I can figure out how to make it accessible from anywhere, securely.
* The site has buttons to Start/Stop a timer for simple time tracking, but will also allow quick manual entries, too.
* Another function of the site will be to generate any reports needed.
* Reports in the form of making a .csv file for the date-range specified.
