# homeschool_log
A web app to help log school subject hours and activities into a database for tracking and reporting.

The idea is to host this website privately within a home for personal use on something simple like a Raspberry Pi even. The goal is to have a simple interface for the user to quickly log a school activity and time, and whatever else is of importance to a homeschool teacher.
